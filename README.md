# SDE Take Home project

I allotted myself 5 hours to work on this project. Unfortunately I was not able to produce a functioning application in that time. Time management was a problem, I spent too much time reading python documentation, and not enough time getting something working so I could itterate quickly.

In DESIGN.md I wrote up a description of the design I intended to work towards with this project.
